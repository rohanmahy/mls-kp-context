     KeyPackage Context Extension for Message Layer Security (MLS)
                    draft-mahy-mls-kp-context-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a Message Layer Security (MLS) KeyPackage
   extension to convey a specific context or anticipated use for the
   KeyPackage.  It is useful when a client provides the KeyPackage out-
   of-band to another client, and wants the specific KeyPackage used
   only in the anticipated context, for example a specific MLS group.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terms MLS client, MLS group, LeafNode, GroupContext, KeyPackage,
   GroupContextExtensions Proposal, Credential, CredentialType, and
   RequiredCapabilities have the same meanings as in the MLS protocol
   [I-D.ietf-mls-protocol].

2.  Introduction

   In some use cases of MLS, a client might wish to provide a KeyPackage
   to another client, but communicate that the specific KeyPackage is
   only to be used in a specific context, for example to join a specific
   MLS group.  This document describes a KeyPackage extension that can
   convey that context.

3.  Extension Description

   This document specifies a KeyPackage MLS extension kp_context of type
   ContextPair.  The syntax is described using the TLS Presentation
   Language [RFC8446]

   Each PerDomainTrustAnchor represents a specific identity domain which
   is expected and authorized to participate in the MLS group.  It
   contains the domain name and the specific trust anchor used to
   validate identities for members in that domain.

   enum {
     reserved(0),
     groupid(1),
     uri(2),
     domain(3),
     jwk_thumbprint(4)
     (255)
   } ContextType;

   struct {
       ContextType context_type;
       opaque context_value<V>;
   } ContextPair;

   ContextPair kp_context;

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document proposes registration of a new MLS Extension Type.

   RFC EDITOR: Please replace XXXX throughout with the RFC number
   assigned to this document

4.1.  kp_context MLS Extension Type

   The kp_context MLS Extension Type is used inside KeyPackage objects.
   It contains a URN Anchors object representing the trust anchors which
   are expected for identity validation inside the MLS group.

     Template:
     Value: 0x000B
     Name: kp_context
     Message(s): This extension may appear in KeyPackage objects
     Recommended: Y
     Reference: RFC XXXX

4.2.  urn:ietf:mls:kp_context:group_id URN registration

   Namespace Identifier:  Requested of IANA (formal) or assigned by IANA
      (informal).

   Version:  1

   Date:  2023-08-01

   Purpose:  Described in Section 3 of RFCXXXX.

   Syntax:  Described in Section 3 of RFCXXXX.

   Assignment:  Described in Section 4.1 of RFCXXXX.

   Security and Privacy:  Described in Section 5 of RFCXXXX.

   Interoperability:  Described in Section 3 of this document.

   Resolution:  Described in Section 3 of this document.

   Documentation:  RFCXXXX

   Additional Information:  none

   Revision Information:  n/a

5.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations of MLS apply.

   The use of this extension may reveal the client's intentions or
   wishes in an out-of-band protocol, which may have weaker privacy
   protections than MLS handshake messages.
